## My process

### Analysis

- Three different designs: mobile, tablet & desktop
- All three designs have the same three parts:
  - the **header** which is a container for a logo, heading and paragraph
  - the **main** element which is made out of two different images and a card:
    - the card is a **section** with a heading, two paragraphs (one of them with a **span**) and two links disguised as buttons.
  - the **footer** with a logo, paragraph and social media icons.
- There's some kind of blured image in the body's background. Also, tablet and desktop design have one more image located in the top right corner of the body.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

1. Make it look good using only regular CSS (no classes yet, just element selector)

- position: absolute can actually make it so hover effects don't activate

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow - Change an svg color](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22252472/how-to-change-the-color-of-an-svg-element) - This helped me understand how to properly apply hovering effect on svg.
- [CodePen - Filter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) -
  This gave me the right values to use for CSS filtering functions.
